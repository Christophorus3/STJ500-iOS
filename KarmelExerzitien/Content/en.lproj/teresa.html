            Holy Mother Teresa of Jesus!</p>
            
            <p>
            You who put yourself totally at the service of Love: Teach us to walk along the path of interior prayer with determination and fidelity with our attention focused on Our Lord, one God in a Trinity of Persons Who is always present in the most intimate part of our being.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the school of Mary, our Mother, strengthen in us the foundation of true humility, of renewed detachment, of fraternal and unconditional love.
            </p>
            <p>
            Share with us your ardent and apostolic love for the Church, that Jesus will become our joy, our hope and our life-force, and never ending exhaustible spring of the deepest intimacy.
            </p>
            <p>
            Bless our large Carmelite family, all our friends, relatives and benefactors. Teach us to pray with you with all our hearts: I am Yours Lord, I was born for You, what do You want of me? Amen.
